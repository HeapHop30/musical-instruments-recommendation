# Musical Instruments Recommendation

*Musical instruments recommendation system in R using user's ratings (Data Analytics Project 2018, USI)*

For my Data Analytics Project, my task is to build at least two recommendation systems in R using a Musical Instruments dataset and to use them to predict the product ratings for some users based on other users’ ratings. Two datasets have been given to me: the first one contains information about user preferences on musical instruments (ratings); the second one contains information about each rated item (metadata).

My main tasks are:
  * Explore and describe the data through some standard descriptive statistics and some graphs;
  * Pre-process the data;
  * Build at least two recommendation systems for musical instruments ratings;
  * Split the data into training and test sets and predict the variable ‘rating’ in the test set;
  * Evaluate and compare the accuracy of the different models.
